# Ash

Ash is a modular Bash framework written with ease of use + reusability in mind.

# Why should you care?

Building command line tools in Bash is an extremely tedious and somewhat enigmatic task.  There's quite a bit of boilerplate code you're going to have to write if you want your script to do more than just one thing, which will only clutter your script.

Ash helps you get rid of all of your boilerplate, and allows you dive right into the code by letting you call functions straight from the command line.

# Installation

First, start off by cloning this repo down to your computer to somewhere you'd like to keep your scripts.

After you have the directory in a good place, symlink the file named `ash`, which is in the root of this repo to somewhere in your $PATH.  `/usr/local/bin` is usually a good place to start.

```
ln -s /path/to/cloned/ash/ash /usr/local/bin/ash
```
