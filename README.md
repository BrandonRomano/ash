# Ash

Ash is a modular Bash framework written with ease of use + reusability in mind.

# Why should you care?

Building command line tools in Bash is an extremely tedious and somewhat enigmatic task.  There's quite a bit of boilerplate code you're going to have to write if you want your script to do more than just one thing, which will only clutter your script.

Ash helps you get rid of all of your boilerplate, and allows you dive right into the code by letting you call functions straight from the command line.

# Installation
